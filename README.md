## Step 1: Get the Docker image

Prerequisite: you should have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) installed.

Start by pulling the `anglican-infcomp` image from the Docker hub:

```
docker pull gbaydin/anglican-infcomp
```

Beware: this might take some time (approximately 15 minutes over a fast LAN connection).
